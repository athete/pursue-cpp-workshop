# Welcome to the 2025 PURSUE C++ Training Module!

This page hosts the lecture notes used for the PURSUE C++ tutorial session. The material assumes that students have had some prior exposure to Python.
Using this baseline knowledge as a foundation, we introduce basic concepts of C++. Later, we highlight and study the differences between Python and C++ and at the very end, we analyze an example of how C++ is used in high-energy physics. 

This material is neither an exhaustive coverage of important topics and concepts in C++, nor is it intended to be digested all at once. Students are encouraged to revisit this page over the course of their internship to hone their understanding of C++. The material presented in this series is partially based on the following (excellent) tutorials, and I highly recommend checking these out in your own time:

* (HSF Basic Modern C++ Tutorial)[https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cpp-webpage/]
* (HSF C++ Course)[https://github.com/hsf-training/cpluspluscourse]
* (The C++ Language)[https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/]
